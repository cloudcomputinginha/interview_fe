I could always find answers to my questions\\\\n\\\\nthrough internet searches, and visually stunning games provided endless\\\\n\\\\nentertainment. Computers, which had been a constant presence since my childhood,\\\\n\\\\nwere familiar and taken for granted, and how they worked was beyond my interest. I\\\\n\\\\nsimply perceived them as convenient tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUpon learning that computers, which I had merely seen as convenient tools, were the\\\\n\\\\nmain players in the Third Industrial Revolution and play a crucial role in the Fourth\\\\n\\\\nIndustrial Revolution, I became eager to delve deeper into the essence of computer\\\\n\\\\nscience. I was particularly fascinated by artificial intelligence technology, which\\\\n\\\\npossesses more extensive and flexible problem-solving capabilities compared to\\\\n\\\\ntraditional programming methods.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn July 2024, during the university's ideathon, I proposed an AI-powered counselor\\\\n\\\\nprotection solution, exploring the practical applicability of emotion analysis and voice\\\\n\\\\nmodulation technologies. Throughout this process, I broadened my understanding of AI\\\\n\\\\napplications and implementation methods by referencing academic papers and books,\\\\n\\\\nwhich later became a catalyst for developing the ability to apply theories to real-world\\\\n\\\\nenvironments in my major studies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI enrolled in Naver Boostcamp AI Tech's Computer Vision track, scheduled for\\\\n\\\\ncompletion from August 2024 to February 2025. I learned the fundamental theories of\\\\n\\\\ndeep learning and had the opportunity to apply these theories through competition\\\\nstyle projects. Through multiple projects, I was able to acquire skills in using generative\\\\n\\\\nAI, data augmentation, and ensemble techniques, as well as experience collaboration\\\\n\\\\nusing platforms such as GitHub, Jira, and Notion. During this process, I recognized the\\\\n\\\\nneed for additional learning in calculus, statistics, and linear algebra for a deeper\\\\n\\\\nunderstanding of theories and recent papers and pursued advanced studies in these\\\\n\\\\nareas. Moreover, through several AI projects, I realized that securing high-quality\\\\n\\\\ndatasets and thoroughly understanding data characteristics are as crucial for improving\\\\n\\\\nmodel performance as incorporating models with numerous parameters.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPage | 1 [Hyeonjun Jo]\\\", '# Page 2\\\\n\\\\n**EDUCATION** **[INHA UNIVERSITY, INCHEON, 2022]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING**\\\\n\\\\n**TOTAL GPA 4.31 / 4.5   MAJOR GPA 4.33 / 4.5**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[NAVER BOOSTCAMP AI TECH 7** **[TH]** **, SEONGNAM, 2024]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**COMPUTER VISION TRACK**\\\\n\\\\n**PROCEED WITH A NUMBER OF COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**PROJECT** **[X-RAY IMAGE SEGMENTATION]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Build a model capable of predicting the class of each pixel in an image\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Apply sharpening filters to mitigate blurring effects that occur during image upscaling\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Establish a baseline code for image segmentation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[OBJECT DETECTION FOR RECYCLING ITEM CLASSIFICATION]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Build a model capable of detecting objects and predicting their classes within images\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ [Provide meaningful insights through data visualization using Streamlit (link)](https://github.com/aaiss0927/level2-objectdetection-cv-12/tree/main/Utils/streamlit)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Perform optimal Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) ensemble by applying Bayesian\\\\noptimization techniques\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[SKETCH IMAGE CLASSIFICATION]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Develop a model capable of predicting the class of sketch images\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Perform data relabeling to remove noise from the training data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Generate images using Stable Diffusion to address class imbalance issues\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[ANALYSIS AND Q&A ON KOREAN ECONOMIC ARTICLES]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Develop a question-answering model for complex Korean economic articles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Apply sliding window technique to overcome limitations of BERT-based models\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Improve string search efficiency by utilizing the KMP algorithm\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Develop a personalized movie recommendation algorithm based on user rating data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Implement a user similarity analysis module utilizing the Pearson correlation\\\\n\\\\ncoefficient\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n￭ Apply user-based collaborative filtering techniques to calculate the average rating of\\\\nsimilar user groups for a specific user\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPage | 2 [Hyeonjun Jo]', '# Page 3\\\\n\\\\n**ACTIVITIES** **[EXECUTIVE]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Sep. 2024 – ] Vice President, Artificial Intelligence Society, Inha University\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[MENTOR]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024] Data Structure Study Group Leader, Student Council\\\\n\\\\n[Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024] Data Structure Tutor, Inha Tutoring Program\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[MEMBER]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Mar. 2022 – Jun. 2024] Member, Computer Engineering Soccer Club\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Mar. 2022 – Dec. 2022] Member, Computer Engineering Volunteer Club\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**AWARDS** [Jul. 2024] Bronze Prize, Computer Engineering Department Ideathon, Dean of Software\\\\n\\\\nConvergence College, Inha University\\\\n\\\\n[Apr. 2023] Academic Excellence Award, Software Convergence College, Dean of Software\\\\n\\\\nConvergence College, Inha University\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**SKILLS** **[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nC (4/5), C++ (4.5/5), Python (4.5/5), Java (4/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[IDE]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVSCode (4.5/5), VS2022 (4.5/5), Eclipse (4/5), IntelliJ (4/5), PyCharm (4/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[TOOL]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGitHub (4/5), Slack (4.5/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[DATABASE]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMySQL (4/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[OPERATING SYSTEM]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLinux (4.5/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**[LIBRARY & FRAMEWORK]**\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNumpy (4.5/5), Pandas (4.5/5), Matplotlib (4/5), OpenCV (4/5), PyTorch (4.5/5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**ENG PROFICIENCY** [Sep. 2023] TOEIC 710\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**MILITARY SERVICE** [Nov. 2019 – Aug. 2021] Republic of Korea Air Force (Honorably discharged)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPage | 3 [Hyeonjun Jo]']\""
